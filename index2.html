<!-- BEE INFO

over 1600 solitary bees in Australia.
S bees are bees that live alone.
They collect nectar and pollen
Solitary and social species of bees.
Far more solitary bees than social.
s bees can live in groups, but don't function as a group. most live alone.
often mistaken for wasps
About 10 social native bees in Australia
2 genus of bees. Tetragonula and Austroplebeia
They are small, they don't sting, but they can bite. And can be quite aggressive.
Tetragonula bite, the other does not.

EU honey bees live in colony with a queen. Can be 60,000 bees strong.
EU bees can travel 5km in search of pollen
Many countries have their own honey bees. For example India has one which is giant and makes tons of honey. Apis dorsita. It prefers cliff faces rather than trees to build on.

Killer bees. Invented by a madman.
Warrick Estevam Kerr. In trying to selectively breed a bee that produced more honey, he wanted to combine an African bee (Apis Mellifera Scutellata) with (Apis Mellifera Iberiensis). A person accidentally let 30 of the African queens out, they mated with local european bees and created what we now call Killer Bees. These are highly aggressive and when swarming, they become frenzied, stinging everything. They will kill you.

One species in the Austroplebeia genus is capable of surviving for 6 years without seeing a flower.
native bees 500-800m in search of pollen
They can pollinate smaller flowers. For example Macadamia trees are not well pollinated by european bees. This has caused a recent agricultural interest in native bees.

Cedar is a preferred wood for bee hives because it has fantastic thermal properties, is pest resistant, moths dislike it, and it survives untreated outside for years.

Eu honeybees can produce 40-100kg honey per year. Costs about $10kg from local producer.
native bees can produce 700ml per year. Costs about $150-200kg from local producer.
